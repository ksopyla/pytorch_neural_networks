# Pytorch neural networks for  beginiers


This repository contains some Pytorch tutorial for beginiers. The goal is to gently intoduce you to pytorch on practical examples. I hope that it will help you start your journey with neural networks.

There are few popular neural network architecture which I teach on workshops or bootcamps like: feedforward, convoutional and recurrent.

## Repository structure

* ./data - folder for downloaded dataset, all data we are working is automatically downloaded at first use


## Examples



### Feedforward neural network

file: **1.feedforward_nn.py**

Network for classifing [CIFAR-10](??) images into one of 10 categories: ['plane', 'car', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']

We build simple network with 1 hidden layer and output layer. As input we pass raw image pixels as 32x32 vector of numbers.
